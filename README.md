### BioD

[BioD](https://github.com/biod/BioD) is a fast and memory efficient bioinformatics library written in the [D programming language](http://dlang.org).
BioD aims to:

* Provide a platform for writing high-performance bioinformatics applications in D. BioD achieves this by:
     - automatic parallelization of tasks where possible for example reading and writing BAM files.
     - reducing the GC overhead by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations
* Offer support for manipulating common biological data formats.
* Write clear documented and maintainable codebase.


### Usage
